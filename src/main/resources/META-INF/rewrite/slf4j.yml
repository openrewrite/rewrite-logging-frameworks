displayName: Migrate Log4j to SLF4J
description: Migrates usage of Apache Log4j to using SLF4J directly. Note, this currently does not modify `log4j.properties` files.

recipeList:
  # note, the idea for this recipe is to be syntactic sugar to easily specify the desire to migrate from any version of log4j (1.x or 2.x, etc.)
  # and migrate it to the latest version of slf4j (1.x currently, but will be 2.x in the future)

description: Use of the traditional Log4j to SLF4J bridge can result in loss of performance, as the Log4j2 messages must be formatted before they can be passed to SLF4J. Note, this currently does not modify `log4j.properties` files.
